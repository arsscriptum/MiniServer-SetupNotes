# Mini Server

I’ve been meaning to set up an Ubuntu server to run some docker containers as a personal project for some time. Using docker, setting up multiple services on a linux server is easy and convenient.

***MEDIA SERVER*** : The server setup below enmables you to automatically handle requests with **Sonarr** or **Radarr**, download them via usenet or torrent, then load them into **Plex** for viewing.

On of the things I love about this build is that we can run a VPN through the torrent container only (**QBbittorrentVPN**). We maintain our anonymity when using public torrent trackers as well as maintain normal download and upload speeds outside of the container.
